Is it okay that we have some of the same exact material in our papers?

You mention pwm twice in the first page, do you want to say why you're using the first time you mention it?

The wording of the first Stakeholders paragraph seems awkward. Maybe name the four stakeholders first, then go into the subdivisions? You may not even have to mention the subdivisions in the first paragraph if you do that in the second paragraph.

I would recommend telling the second Stakeholders paragraph a little more like a story, the way we did in the presentation, so that we convey what we did with the students more clearly. It seems to jump around a little bit. For example, you say "The student teachers played the unique part of being both student participants—on day one, when we were the instructors—and teachers—on day two, when they were in charge" which could be confusing if the reader doesn't know the full story of what we did to begin with.

I like that you included the student observers. They are definitely an important stakeholder group that people wouldn't think of right away.

Explain why the fourth group of students may benefit indirectly - because they may be taught eventually? Because they now understand their capability to design from knowing that their peers went through the process?

Maybe at the end of the Mama Mcha paragraph add that she made sure at least half of the students participating in our workshop would be girls.

Final stakeholders paragraph: "the outcome of this workshop IS meant to...?" And make it more clear that the IDDS project teams were working in the same site (Orkolili) but not on the same project/research that we did.
